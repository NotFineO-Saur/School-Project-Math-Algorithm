# School-Project-Math-Algorithm
I had to do this for school, so I put it here too. I was gonna leave it alone but decided to keep working on it for practice and like because. Have fun with it.
Do whatever with this code, there isn't much. PLus it's open source so I asked for it. I also don't / didn't have a license, so there is that.
Yeehaw
